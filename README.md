## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand the basics of web development.


## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, you need the following tools installed on your local machine:
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mruneek/simple-personal-portfolio.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setting Up the Project
Create the main HTML files: `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html`. Add a basic HTML structure to each file.

### 2. Adding Styles
Create a `css` folder and a `styles.css` file inside it. Link this CSS file to your HTML files and start adding styles to design your portfolio.

### 3. Creating Sections
In `index.html`, create sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact. Use semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.

### 4. Styling the Portfolio
Use CSS to style each section. This includes setting up a layout, adding colors, fonts, and spacing to make your portfolio look professional.

### 5. Adding Content
Fill each section with content. Include your bio, a list of projects with descriptions, and a contact form.

### 6. Final Touches
Add any finishing touches, such as hover effects, transitions, and responsive design to ensure your portfolio looks good on all devices.
